DAN’s **stack is not linear—it’s modular**. This means **each layer functions independently**, allowing teams to **plug in where they need** rather than being forced to adopt the entire system at once.

This flexibility makes DAN the **ultimate adoption engine** for digital ownership—businesses don’t need to **rebuild everything from scratch** or force their teams to adopt complex blockchain tools.
